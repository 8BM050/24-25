## Learning Outcomes

::: {.callout-important title="Principal Learning Outcome 7"}
Construct a linear dynamic model of biochemical processes using the law of mass action
:::

After this lecture, you should be able to:

1. Describe the law of mass action and explain how it can be used to model biochemical processes.
2. Explain the concept of a dynamic model and give examples of dynamic models in human metabolism.
3. Provide the differential equations when given a reaction network, using the law of mass action.
4. Use Euler's method to numerically solve a first-order ordinary differential equation.
5. Explain strategies to improve the accuracy of Euler's method.
