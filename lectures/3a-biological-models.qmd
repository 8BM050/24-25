description: "In this lecture, we will move to more complicated examples of mass-action kinetics and use our knowledge of differential equations to describe signalling systems and feedback loops. We will also take a look at enzyme kinetics and the Michaelis-Menten equation, and extend this to be able to model competitive inhibition."
