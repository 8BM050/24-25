description: "In this lecture, we will move to more complicated examples of mass-action kinetics and use our knowledge of differential equations to describe signalling systems and feedback loops. We will also take a look at enzyme kinetics and the Michaelis-Menten equation, and extend this to be able to model reversible inhibition."

After this lecture, you should be able to:

1. Model various stimulatory and inhibitory signalling systems using ordinary differential equations.
2. Derive the Michaelis-Menten equation from a simple enzyme-substrate reaction.
3. Explain the terms in the Michaelis-Menten equation and give a biological interpretation of these terms.
4. Extend the Michaelis-Menten equation to include the three types of reversible inhibition.
5. Use Hill-type kinetics to model cooperative binding in enzyme kinetics and gene regulation.
6. Locate and explain positive and negative feedback loops in differential equations.
7. Calculate the steady-state conditions for a simple system of ordinary differential equations.
8. Explain the concept of bistability and setpoints in biological systems.
