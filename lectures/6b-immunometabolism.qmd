## Learning Outcomes

::: {.callout-important title="Principal Learning Outcomes ?"}
4. Describe the function of the liver, adipose tissue, and other metabolic tissues in retaining homeostasis through hormonal and neural regulation
5. Describe energy homeostasis in daily life and how it changes due to stress, exercise, and disease
:::

After this lecture, you should be able to:

1. Describe fasting and fed metabolism (carbohydrates, lipids, protein) and their transition and regulation (insulin, glucagon)

including:

- Understand how (cell-specific) metabolic pathways relate to physiological function of organs and tissuess
- Understand energy sources for the brain
<!-- - Be aware of metabolic changes during pregnancy (mother and fetus) and after birth-->
