:::

After this lecture, you should be able to:

- Understand and describe Understand mechanisms of transport across cell membranes for ions, carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids.
- Understand mechanisms of intracellular metabolic regulation at different time-scales.
- Describe concepts in endocrinology, such as hormone axes and response loops.
- Understand mechanisms of hormone receptors and signal transduction.
