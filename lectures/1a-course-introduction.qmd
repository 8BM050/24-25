## Learning Outcomes
During this lecture, we'll address principal learning outcome number 1, which is:

::: {.callout-important title="Principal Learning Outcome 1"}
Describe the molecular details of the conversion of the body's main energy sources (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) into energy.
:::

After this lecture, you should be able to:

1.  Describe the goal of metabolism in the human body and name its main energy sources.
2.  Give the definition of metabolic regulation, and explain its three main components (energy storage expenditure, and delivery).
3.  Explain the chemical concepts of polarity, osmosis, and reduction-oxidation reactions in context of human metabolism.
4.  Identify reducing agents and oxidizing agents in a chemical reaction.
5.  Give the molecular structure of carbohydrates and lipids (and proteins) and name basic properties in context of human (energy) metabolism.
6.  Explain the difference between catabolic and anabolic reactions in human metabolism.
7.  Give examples of energy carrying intermediates used in human metabolism and relate these to the measures of energy status in cells.
8.  Explain the difference in substrate storage and delivery between carbohydrates and lipids in human metabolism.
9.  Give the main pathways of the metabolic (energy) flux in the human body 
10. Locate and explain the subprocesses of the metabolic energy pathways: 
  - **general:** TCA cycle, electron transport chain
  - **glucose:** Glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, lactate and pyruvate pathways, glycogen pathways
  - **lipids:** beta-oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, ketone body pathways, carnitine shuttle, lipolysis, lipogenesis
  - **amino acids:** amino acid catabolism, urea cycle, amino acid synthesis
