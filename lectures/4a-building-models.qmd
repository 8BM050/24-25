author: "Shauna O'Donovan"
description: "In this lecture, we will finalize the modelling component of the course by discussing whole-body models. We will cover multi-compartment models, compartments-as-delays, modelling methods of administration, repeated doses, and building models from text using word equations."

## Learning Outcomes
During this lecture, we'll address principal learning outcomes number 8 and 10, which are:

::: {.callout-important title="Principal Learning Outcome 8"}
Explain the function of different terms in a simple system of (possibly nonlinear) ordinary differential equations.
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Principal Learning Outcome 10"}
Use Python to simulate and analyse systems of ordinary differential equations
:::

1. (Multi-)compartment models
2. Compartments-as-delays
3. Modelling methods of administration
4. Repeated doses (saturation vs. linear kinetics)
5. Building models from text using word equations
