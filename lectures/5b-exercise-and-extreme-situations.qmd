## Learning Outcomes

::: {.callout-important title="Principal Learning Outcomes:"}
4. Describe the function of the liver, adipose tissue, and other metabolic tissues in retaining homeostasis through hormonal and neural regulation
5. Describe energy homeostasis in daily life and how it changes due to stress, exercise, and disease

:::

After this lecture, you should be able to:

- Describe relation between lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis
- Describe the functional organization in relation to energy metabolism and buffering in muscle (skeletal, cardiac) 
- Describe the physiological aspects of exercise, with focus on skeletal muscle (different types of exercise, different energy sources)
- Be aware of metabolic changes during pregnancy (mother and fetus) and after birth

- Understand energy sources for the brain
<!---Be aware of some concepts in metabolomics-->
