## Learning Outcomes

### Principal Learning outcome:
- Endocrinology is both a medical specialism dealing with diagnosing/ treatment of endocrine systems, and a basic science describing the endocrine physiology of endocrine organs.
- The most important human processes are regulated by hormones
- Laboratory hormone testing is essential to assess human endocrine systems, but the (dynamic) context is more important than the numeric results itself.
- Interpretation by specialist like a clinical chemist-endocronologist is key for clinical decision making.
 
### Lecture learning outcome:
Interpretation of endocrine laboratory testing is dependent on multiple factors, including:
- Kinetics
- Time of sampling
- Matrix (blood versus saliva)
- Exogeneous stimuli (eg dexamethasone, ynacthen, insulin)

Interpretation of endocrine Laboratory results related to:
- Hypocortisolism
- Hypercortisolism
