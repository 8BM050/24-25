## Learning Outcomes

::: {.callout-important title="Principal Learning Outcome 5"}
Describe energy homeostasis in daily life and how it changes due to stress, exercise, and disease.
:::

After this lecture, you should be able to:

* Understand how (cell-specific) metabolic pathways relate to physiological function of organs and tissuess

* Understand how the liver contributes to energy homeostasis

1. Describe fasting and fed metabolism (carbohydrates, lipids, protein) and their transition and regulation (insulin, glucagon) 
2. Describe lipoprotein metabolism (fasting and postprandial)
3. Describe relation between lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis

-Introduction of inborn errors of metabolism
