## Learning Outcomes
::: {.callout-important title="Principal Learning Outcomes:"}
4. Describe the function of the liver, adipose tissue, and other metabolic tissues in retaining homeostasis through hormonal and neural regulation.
5. Describe energy homeostasis in daily life and how it changes due to stress, exercise, and disease.
:::

After this lecture, you should be able to:


1. Understand how the liver contributes to energy homeostasis
2. Describe lipoprotein metabolism (fasting and postprandial)
<!--3. Describe relation between lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis-->

<!--Understand energy sources for the brain-->
- Understand how inborn errors of metabolism can affect the metabolic system
* Understand how (cell-specific) metabolic pathways relate to physiological function of organs and tissuess
* Describe fasting and fed metabolism (carbohydrates, lipids, protein) and their transition and regulation (insulin, glucagon)

## Book Chapters
